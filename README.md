## About the Project

This project explores an Airbnb dataset using Tableau to analyze key metrics such as pricing by zip code, revenue trends, and listing characteristics. The goal is to discover insights that highlight patterns in demand, pricing, and competition among different types of properties.

The dashboard was created as part of a data visualization learning journey with Alex the analyst on Youtube using real-world datasets from Kaggle.

## The Key Insights
Listings with 5–6 bedrooms gived the highest average income, indicating strong earning potential for larger places.

Smaller listings (1–2 rooms) showed higher demand, but with lower average income per listing.

Due to lower competition, larger properties present a strong opportunity for hosts or sellers to stand out in the market.

Demand increased noticeably toward the end of the year, likely due to holiday seasons and increased travel activity.
